In the time that I am developing this application (server), I am reading books about design patterns and stuff, but I don't know if I do it correctly, so I will implement it bit by bit, meaning I apply 1 design pattern at this place, doesn't mean I will do it in another place, because if the way I do is wrong, it will save so much time to just revert back.

But of course, If I don't mark it as todo, i will forget to apply the design patterns in all the place it needs to be.

1. Apply Interface instead of using concrete services.
2. Finish all Specs for the services.
3. Refactor the codes to be more readable.
4. Always look at things to see improvement.
