# <p style="text-align:center"> ⭐ HELLO WORLD TO ALL MY FRIENDS READING THIS PROJECT ⭐ </p>

<p style="text-align:center">This is a improved project (server) for Zen. The reason why I did this is because the old codes are messy, no Designs at the start and no dedication when writing codes. All results in a project that is nearly impossible to maintain, understand or even change one bit.<br/><br/> That's why this project is created, it aims for more well-built. I have started to draw some diagrams, learn about clean codes and stuff like that. It will make the project more mature and can even do more things in the future.</p>
